# AAF (Abstract Argumentation Frameworks)

This repository contains a set of Lisp code designed for the generation of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AAFs), computation of their extensions, and searching for frameworks and extensions with specific properties.

## Features

- **Generate AAFs**: Tools to create Abstract Argumentation Frameworks from scratch.
- **Compute Extensions**: Implementations of various semantics for computing extensions of AAFs.
- **Search for Specific Properties**: Methods for searching AAFs and their extensions for desired properties.
  
## Requirements

- **Lisp**: The code is written in Common Lisp, and thus requires a Common Lisp implementation (e.g., SBCL, CLISP).

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License (see the file LICENSE.txt).
